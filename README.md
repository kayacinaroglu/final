This project was rather challenging for me because the logic of prolog didn't come to me intuitively.
I wanted to push myself and get better at prolog, so I chose this project.

I was tasked with creating a knowledge base of different courses, setting information for those courses and postulating which were prerequisites for which.
I first set up all the facts listed in the task, which I think I did mostly accurately.
Then, I set to implement the rules. My implementation for can_take and intermediate functions do not work properly and I do not understand why.
I tried various things but they didn't work. I will ask for guidance during class on friday. I probably only have small mistakes.

Simple queries do work. Queries regarding nointro and upper_level work. I couldn't get intermediate and can_take to work, but I will ask before or after class to find peace.

I should have asked my questions on thursday or earlier, but I thought I could solve all the problems on my own but was mistaken.
